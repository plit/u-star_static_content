			<p><br>Enjoying the momentum of being Shining Star for three straight weeks, 16-year-old Rocelle Jeanne Solquillo of Bacolod is the favorite to win it all. “I am happy to be named the Shining Star, but much is expected because all eyes are on me. I will just continue doing my best to make my family proud.”
            </p>

			<p>
                Her fellow BacolodnonLee’Anna Justine Weber Layumas also presents some stiff competition. Battling all the way from the regional screening rounds to the live shows, the 22-year-old has constantly been on top with her, with her angelic and very soothing voice. “I really hope that my performance will move the people.”
            </p>
			<p>
                15-year-old Remy Luntayao of Laguna has grown more mature and polished, progress she has evidently shown over the course of the competition. She is slowly but surely proving herself worthy of the tag “total performer.” “I was told that my talents couldn’t make it out of our house or barangay, and now I am here. I am proud to have proven them wrong, and I hope to continue doing so.”
            </p>
			<p>
                The youngest of the group, 13-year-old Krezia Mae Toñacao has been the resident OPM specialist. Continuously exhibiting grace and experience beyond her age, she has impressed the judges and hosts with her immense talent and even greater potential. “I will give more heart into my songs, which I hope I could make everyone else feel.”
			</p>
			<p>
                “The girls are absolutely amazing. I really look forward to seeing them shine and stand out more during the finals,” says judge and mentor Jaya. Papa Jack looks forward to whose performance will shine out, and who will break out as a star. For the last time, join co-hosts MicoAytona and Venus Raj as they discover newer sides of our contestants.
            </p>

            <p>Of course, Ogie Alcasid will be there to lead the charge. “It’s good to see that they have evolved as performers, you can see the difference from when they started in the competition. I’m expecting a lot and I’m sure they will deliver,” shares the energetic host.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of auditions, ten episodes, one winner. Who will be the inaugural champion of RisingStars Philippines? Watch the grand finals this Saturday, May 23, 10PM on TV5.</p>

		<h2>From Phone to Fame</h2>
        Hosted by Ogie Alcasid and Venus Raj, TV5’s newest primetime offeringis the competition for the selfie generation—a chance for homegrown talents to rise from phone to fame and become the country’s next musical sensation.



        <div class="read_more_content_g_2">
            <p>A revolution is comingto your television screens this summer, March 14 to be exact.</p>

            <p>RisingStars Philippines provides a game-changing concept and a refreshing way to engage its audience
                through the staple of Filipino culture—the Karaoke. After searching through 20 cities from across the
                country, putting up booths in over 200 stops in major malls, barangays and schools, and finding
                musically gifted individuals with the potential to become a star, they are still looking for more.</p>

            <p>The competition puts a premium on showcasing talent, and making their dreams more within reach. Aside
                from the booths, auditions were held at the comfort of others’ living roomsthrough the RisingStars
                Philippines Mobile App. Available on the Google Play store for Android phones, joining made easy and
                hassle-free, with no money or time spent in long lines and traveling.</p>

            <p>Auditions were also held via the website (www.risingstars.ph), where hopefuls could record and submit
                entries. Any Filipino over the age of 13 is eligible to enter the competition.</p>

            <p>After months of screenings, online voting, and eliminations, the semi-finalists of each city were pitted
                in the regional live shows to screen and determine the cast for the televised finals. With 12 live shows
                held in various malls, thousands of guests and supporters cheered on their favorite contenders.</p>

            <p>What makes this competition stand out from all the others is how it reaches out to the entire nation and
                takes advantage of the digital age. An entirely new degree of audience participation awaits viewers, as
                they can become part of the show at any given time: through the mobile app or website, anyone can sing,
                those who didn’t make it to the initial screenings can still record and submit a challenge entry against
                any of the current finalists, and get a chance to replace their slot on the show. This unique challenge
                concept presents a more democratized playing field, providing everyone his or her own chance to shine by
                showcasing their talents live on national television.</p>

            <p>RisingStars Philippinesis hosted by Ogie Alcasid and Venus Raj, with MicoAytona as roving reporter. Ogie
                is excited for the show, and for TV5, as it is one of the few singing programs/contests they have.
                “There is no doubt that all of them are good, but we are looking for a rising star,” he says. “That is
                another ingredient we are looking for.”</p>

            <p>A former pageant contestant herself, Venus says “The journey is more important than the destination. We
                all want to win and have the prize, but it is merely secondary. What is important is that you prove
                yourself, that you overcome the trials within you.”</p>

            <p>The show premieres Saturday, March 14 at 9PM on TV5 and airs until May 17 every Saturday and Sunday from
                9 to 10PM.</p>
